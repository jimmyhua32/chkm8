Project Statement: How might young adults between the ages of 18-25 in America utilize a gamified approach to mental wellness so that they can improve their mental well-being?

## Why does the problem matter?

Teens struggle to use resources to help improve mental well-being because they are hesitant to visit primary care or talk to a human regarding any personal issues. Adolescents struggle with the transition to adulthood when it comes to mental conditions as there is a lack of information given and taught to adolescents in which they are flooded with and overwhelmed by the information given to them as adults. The current resources that exist are not appealing for those within the audience age range we are targeting. The average is in front of their screens for around 7 hours a day. Of these 7 hours, these teens are filling these hours with a majority of social media or entertainment applications rather than productivity, mental health, or well-being applications. A report stated that 49.5% of adolescents experienced their well-being and mental conditions being negatively impacted. Because those in the age range of 18-25 rely heavily on smartphones (seen by the average 7 hours/day screen-time), there is a problem of a lack of applications that exist in which make up a larger percentage of those 7 hours versus the other social media and entertainment applications.

## What need is not being met?

The need for a resource that those aged 18-25 can find free, easy-to-use, fun, and all while supporting their mental wellness. Upon researching existing applications or resources that exist, we notice that they don't meet the criteria mentioned above.

## What is the impact of inaction?

As time continues, the percentage and number of teens experience mental issues continues to increase. What this tells us is that current resources that exist are not contributing to the problem for those in the age range of 18-25. By not acting on this problem, we can expect to continually see this increase in percentages and numbers.
